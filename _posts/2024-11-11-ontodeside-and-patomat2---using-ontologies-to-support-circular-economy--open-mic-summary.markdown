##### Abstract

Circular economy is a hot topic nowadays. One of the challenges is ensuring that all entities in a product lifecycle are able to communicate
with each other and share information.

The goal of the [Onto-DESIDE](https://ontodeside.eu/) is addressing these challenges in a way that supports both humans and machines. Semantic Web ontologies
have been selected as a means to provide this interoperability. In particular, each step in a product lifecycle may be described by an ontological vocabulary
specific to that particular industry domain. Prof. Svátek and his colleagues
contribute to the Onto-DESIDE project, among other things, by helping to create a semi-automated way of mapping these vocabularies using transformation patterns.

To facilitate this goal, [PatOMat2](https://github.com/Onto-DESIDE-VSE/patomat2) - a pattern-based ontology transformation tool - has been developed. The session thus also includes a short demo
of PatOMat2.
