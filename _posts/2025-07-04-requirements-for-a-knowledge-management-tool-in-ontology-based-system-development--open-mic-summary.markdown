##### Abstract

The presentation outlined the current tool stack used by KBSS for knowledge management in ontology-based system development, which depends heavily on input from domain experts. The primary tools — [TermIt](https://kbss-cvut.github.io/termit-web), [Ontographer](https://ontographer.github.io/ontographer-demo/), and [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) — are used by both domain experts and ontology engineers to build UFO-based [1] ontologies. Case studies in aircraft maintenance and reliability modeling highlighted challenges in knowledge extraction and formalization. Key use cases include extracting concepts and relations from documents, exploring knowledge within ontologies, formalizing tabular data, and rapid prototyping of digital forms. Several limitations of the existing tools were identified:
- lack of support for custom IRIs across tools
- poor synchronization between models of different tools
- limited multilingual support within vocabularies
- weak capabilities for searching and exploring developed ontologies
