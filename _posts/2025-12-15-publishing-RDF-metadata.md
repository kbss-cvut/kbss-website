On Friday 9th January 2026 at 10:30 [Michal Med](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#michal-med) will talk about effective publishing of RDF based metadata (based on RDF top level vocabularies for metadata description, such as SKOS, Dublin Core, DCAT etc.). You can join us live at [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss).

##### Abstract

In the recent years, more and more projects and initiatives focus on publication of (not only) open data in the machine readable form. This is however related to the discovery of information about published dataset for various reasons, from finding relevant data sources to the overall statistics about published data, creating dashboards or reusing and interconnecting data. For all these targets, the data must be properly described with metadata. In various fields of research, various metadata profiles are well-known and widely used. It is best practice to reuse top level concepts of metadata ontologies, such as SKOS[1], Dublin Core[2], DCAT[3] etc. This is something that is already taken into account in the process of creation of metadata profiles. But it is also important to publish metadata using the catalogues that allow users to fully utilize the benefits of using graph metadata.

In this talk we will dicuss how the RDF metadata are usually published, which tools are used and how can it be enhanced. The focus is aimed at the data management ecosystem called piveau[4] as a metadata catalogue for publishing and harvesting metadata from various providers. This tool is used as a metadata catalogue for european data portals and we are thinking about using it in the Czech node of European Open Science Cloud [5] as a metadata management tool and catalogue.
