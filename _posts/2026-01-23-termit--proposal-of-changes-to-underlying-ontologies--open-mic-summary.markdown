session with the topic \"TermIt: proposal of changes to underlying ontologies.\"

##### Abstract

[TermIt](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit) is a [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/)-compatible terminology
management system developed by the [KBSS](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/).
It was created with a certain methodology in mind. However, several use cases and years of real-world experience present
have shown the methodology needs to be updated, requiring changes to the ontologies underlying TermIt.

In this session, we discuss what these changes are and in particular how they will affect existing deployments of TermIt.

The changes discussed are:

* Translation of the ontologies underlying TermIt into English
* Simplification of the vocabulary-glossary-model construct
