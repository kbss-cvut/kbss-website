The Open mic session starts on Friday 25th October 2024 at 10:30 via [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). The speaker is [Max Chopart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-chopart) who is going to talk about Application of System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to enhance software safety in System-Intensive Environments.


##### The abstract

As software development increasingly operates within complex, system-intensive environments, ensuring the safety and resilience of these systems is crucial. System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) provides a powerful framework for identifying risks and preventing failures in such environments. Originally developed for safety-critical fields, STPA is now gaining relevance in software engineering, helping developers manage complexity, improve safety, and build more robust systems. In this presentation, weâ€™ll explore how STPA can be applied to software projects, enabling developers to anticipate issues and design safer, high-performing systems without sacrificing agility.
