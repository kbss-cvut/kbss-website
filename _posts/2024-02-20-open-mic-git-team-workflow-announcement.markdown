##### Abstract

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) has been a staple of software development for years. Allowing both individuals and teams to manage
their source code with ease (especially thanks to Git platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org)).
However, working on the same code base in a team can be a challenge and while Git and Git platforms provide means to facilitate
such teamwork (branches, pull/merge requests), finding the right workflow for such a team may not be an easy task. In this talk,
Petr Aubrecht will share his experience and best practices for finding such a workflow.
