title: "Student Thesis Presentations"
categories: [ Open Mic, Teaching ]
---

On Thursday 5th June, students affiliated with KBSS presented their theses in preparation for their defense.

##### The abstract

Instead of a regular Open Mic presentation, this session allowed students whose theses are supervised or reviewed by
members of KBSS to rehearse their thesis defense presentation and get valuable feedback before the "real" defenses
that take place mid-June.

Each of the 6 students gave a short talk (5â€“10 minutes) about their bachelor/master thesis, got feedback on the
presentation, and had a chance to compare their presentation with their peers.

The topics included:

- extensions of software libraries and tools developed at KBSS ([JOPA](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/jopa), [SPipes](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/s-pipes), [TermIt](http://kbss-cvut.github.io/termit-web))
- Various domain applications (photo albums, theater management, etc.)

The students also utilized a variety of technologies, including:

- Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Jakarta EE
- JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Java Server Faces, Web Components

_Note: This was a closed session, and it was not recorded._
