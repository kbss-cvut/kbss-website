##### Abstract

Monitoring quality is a key activity during the whole ontology lifecycle that requires adequate tools to provide overview over changing ontologies. In this paper we present an interactive dashboard framework for monitoring ontology metrics and quality indicators using Kibana and ElasticSearch. While the framework is designed as generic, we present a prominent use-case for OBO Foundry ontologies, backed by ROBOT metrics and quality indicators.
