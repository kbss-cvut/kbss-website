The next Open mic session starts on Friday 8th November 2024 at 10:30 at [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). Our guest [Vojtěch Svátek](https://nb.vse.cz/~svatek/) will discuss the use of ontology pattern-based matching and transformation in Onto-DESIDE - a Horizon Europe project researching means of supporting circular economy.


##### Abstract

The goal of the [Onto-DESIDE](https://ontodeside.eu/) is addressing challenges that prevent sharing of data and making it usable by both humans and machines. In particular, the focus is on helping the industry share knowledge in order to transition to a more circular model of economy. Prof. Svátek and his colleagues
contribute, among other things, by helping to create a semi-automated way of mapping the vocabularies of various industry domains using transformation patterns.

To facilitate this goal, [PatOMat2](https://github.com/Onto-DESIDE-VSE/patomat2) - a pattern-based ontology transformation tool - has been developed. Prof. Svátek will discuss the motivation and principles of using patterns in ontology mapping and transformation. At the end of the session, a short demo of PatOMat2 will be presented.
