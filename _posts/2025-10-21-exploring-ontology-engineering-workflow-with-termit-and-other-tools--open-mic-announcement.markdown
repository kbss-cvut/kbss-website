Content: The Open mic session starts on Friday 31 October 2025 at 10:30 via [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). [Bogdan Kostov](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#bogdan-kostov) how to use TermIt and other tools when building domain ontologies. 

##### Abstract
This session presents evaluation of using TermIt in the process of building a domain/application ontology based on a corpus of domain specific text. The motivation behind this using TermIt is to improve collaboration between domain experts and ontology engineers. TermIt allows for easy term definition and semi-automated text annotation, features which allow domain experts to define terms and document their usage in a text corpus. To continue the ontology engineering process, e.g., formalizing concepts and testing, defined domain terms and annotated text corpus in TermIt has to be exported and processed. For example defined terms can be extracted in an ontology file compatible with Protege where terms formal descriptions and organized in taxonomy. Annotated texts can be extracted and can be used for verification and validation, e.g. how many concepts occur in the text corpus, fetch usages of a particular term to compare with the text and formal based definitions. 

Experience using TermIt in this scenario are discussed. This includes challenges importing and exporting ontologies and text documents into and from TermIt as well limitations of TermIt vocabulary management and text annotation features. 

The examples in this session are mainly based on a case study building an airport safety domain ontology using TermIt.
