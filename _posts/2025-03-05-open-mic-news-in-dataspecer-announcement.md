##### Abstract

DataSpecer is a tool developed and maintained by the people from department of Software Engineering at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University. The tool is meant for creating data specifications based on the existing RDF Vocabularies, but it also allows users to create those vocabularies and generate artifacts such as formal schemas for the specifications and also documentation.

Since the last presentation, the tool changed a lot. Michal will come with basic overview and live demo of the tool, including installation, import of vocabularies, profiling the specification and also publishing the outputs using GutHub pages.
