##### Abstract

For several years, there has been an effort to build a knowledge base of Czech legislation (and similar normative
documents).
This knowledge base consists of glossaries of terms used in the documents and, in some cases, also ontological models
representing deeper relationships between the terms. However, creation of such artifacts has been purely manual work,
requiring a lot of time and expertise.

In this talk, I will present my experiments with using LLMs to extract glossaries from Czech legislative documents. I
will discuss the approach, sketch the pipeline that could be used for a large-scale application, and present initial
results of the experiments.
