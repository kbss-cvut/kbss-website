##### Abstract

We presented a short paper about [TermIt](http://kbss-cvut.github.io/termit-web) at the [Developers Workshop](https://semantics2025.semdev.org/)
of the Semantics 2025 conference. Let us discuss some other interesting topics that were presented at the conference.

Namely:

* [QLever](https://qlever.dev/) SPARQL query engine
* [Jelly](https://jelly-rdf.github.io/dev/) RDF binary serialization format
