##### The abstract

The presentation "Enhancing Software Safety in System-Intensive Environments: Applying System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)" illustrates how STPA can significantly improve software safety by identifying essential safety requirements early in development. STPA, part of the System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) framework, focuses on understanding system interactions to reveal potential hazards that might not be immediately apparent. By analyzing control structures and specifying safety constraints, STPA allows developers to proactively address risks and design safer, more resilient software systems, especially in complex environments where traditional safety assessments might fall short.

Through a structured analysis, STPA helps teams identify unsafe control actions that could lead to system losses if not properly managed. This approach is valuable not only for preventing incidents but also for aligning software with strict safety requirements in industries like aviation and beyond. By applying STPA during software development, engineers can systematically uncover and document safety requirements, guiding the creation of software that supports robust and secure system behavior. This methodology thus strengthens software safety assurance, ensuring that safety-critical systems are better equipped to handle real-world challenges.
