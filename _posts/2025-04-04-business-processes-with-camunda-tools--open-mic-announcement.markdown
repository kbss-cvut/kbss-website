##### Abstract

Most organizations operate based on _business processes_. Information systems are developed to support these processes,
often implicitly.
However, more complex processes require and explicit approach - modeling the process using BPMN and using a _workflow
engine_ to support executing it. In this talk, we will discuss how modeling and execution of business processes can be
done using free tools from [Camunda](https://camunda.com/).
