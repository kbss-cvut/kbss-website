##### Abstract

2024 will bring new releases of several key Semantic Web standards and software libraries. These will include RDF 1.2, SPARQL 1.2,
Jena 5, and RDF4J 5. This talk will provide an overview of the changes that these releases are expected to bring, both from
the viewpoint of a Semantic Web practitioner and of a developer who builds information systems based on the Semantic Web.
