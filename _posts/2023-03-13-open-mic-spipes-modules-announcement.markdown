##### The abstract

SPipes Modules is a collection of specific module types used in SPipes, a tool for managing semantic pipelines defined in RDF. These modules are stateless transformations of input data that can be instantiated in a pipeline. They are implemented in Java and defined in RDF.

SPipes Modules Utils provides developer tools for working with SPipes module types, such as a Maven Archetype for generating a clean template for a new module type and a Maven Plugin for post-processing existing modules. This session will explore the most used SPipes Modules, their features, and how to work with them.
