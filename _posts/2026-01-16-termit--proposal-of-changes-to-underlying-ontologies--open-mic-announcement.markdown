On Friday 23 January 2026 at 10:30 [Martin Ledvinka](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#martin-ledvinka) is going to
talk about proposed changes to the ontologies underlying TermIt.
Join the session at [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss).

##### Abstract

[TermIt](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit) is a [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/)-compatible terminology
management system developed by the [KBSS](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/).
It was created with a certain methodology in mind. However, several use cases and years of real-world experience present
a chance to update the ontologies underlying TermIt to better reflect the needs of users and to increase the system's
potential into the future.

In this talk, we will discuss:

* Translation of the ontologies underlying TermIt into English
* Simplification of the vocabulary-glossary-model construct
* Implications of the proposed changes to existing deployments
