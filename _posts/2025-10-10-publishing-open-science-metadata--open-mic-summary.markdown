##### Abstract

The objective of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)[1] is to provide researchers and innovators in Europe with an open and trusted multi-disciplinary environment where they can publish, find and reuse data, tools and services for research and innovation. Through this environment, EOSC aims to mobilise, align and scale resources across Europe to accelerate open science, higher productivity and increased reproducibility and trust in research.

Organization behind the implenmentation is EOSC Federation and as it usually is, federation is gathered from the national cells. The goals are iplemented mainly on the national structure. One of the main goals is development of multidisciplnary data repository to allow researchers publish their data in accordance with FAIR principles [2] (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). It seems that only way to publish it this way is to set up metadata catalogue and describe data using newly created interoperable metadata profile.

This profile called Czech Core Metadaa Model for Research Data[7] was created in 1st half of 2025 in cooperation with National Technical Library and CESNET based on widely used metadata profiles DataCite[3], Dublin Core[4] and DCAT[5] using tool DataSpecer[6], that was already presented in Open Mic.

Currently it is being implemented in National Metadata Directory (NMA) and Catch-all repository of EOSC project. This talk describes the creation of metadata profile and possible problems with its implementation.
