The Open mic session takes place on Friday 28th November 2025 at 10:30 on [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). Our external colleague [Max Chopart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-chopart) gives talk about safety integration by bridging STPA and MBSA using ontology driven approach.


##### Abstract

Safety assessments in modern, complex systems require comprehensive approaches that account for both non-failure and failure scenarios. This presentation introduces an ontology-driven framework designed to efficiently integrate two powerful, yet distinct, safety analysis methodologies: System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and Model-Based Safety Analysis (MBSA).
STPA offers a broad, hazard-based approach, capturing scenarios driven by systemic, human, and organizational factors. MBSA, conversely, excels at detailed failure-propagation analysis. While complementary, bridging these two requires a systematic mechanism to map relevant information.

Our core contribution is a domain ontology that acts as an intelligent interface with two key functions:
1. Filtering: It systematically analyzes STPA scenarios to identify and isolate those suitable for MBSA's failure-based analysis.
1. Translation: It automatically converts these filtered STPA scenarios into MBSA-compatible "feared events" (observers), minimizing manual effort and error.

This systematic mapping allows us to leverage STPA's wide-ranging hazard identification to seed a more focused and thorough fault-propagation analysis in MBSA.

**Key Takeaway:** This integration method streamlines the safety assessment process, enhances accuracy by reducing human intervention, and creates a more comprehensive, unified safety and reliability framework. Our early results demonstrate a more efficient and structured utilization of both STPA and MBSA's strengths, critical for managing the complexities of contemporary safety-critical systems.
