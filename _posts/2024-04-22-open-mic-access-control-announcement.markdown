##### Abstract

The adoption of RDF databases for enterprise transactional data is evolving. A significant barrier to wider use is the inadequate access control mechanisms. Many RDF databases allow you to restrict access to everything or nothing at all. However, finer control is often necessary, such as limiting access to a specific named graph or even an individual RDF triple. We will explore several access control options that current RDF databases provide.
