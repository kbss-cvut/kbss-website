##### Abstract

[Semantics 2025](https://2025-eu.semantics.cc/) was held in Vienna. Besides
presenting [TermIt](http://kbss-cvut.github.io/termit-web) at
the [Developers Workshop](https://semantics2025.semdev.org/), we also
attended the conference for one day. In this Open Mic session, we discuss two interesting presentations from the
conference.

###### QLever

[QLever](https://qlever.dev/) is a SPARQL query engine written in C++ boasting impressive performance numbers compared to SPARQL engines that
are a part of existing triple stores.

We discuss its pros and cons, especially w.r.t. our use cases.

###### Jelly

[Jelly](https://jelly-rdf.github.io/dev/) is an RDF binary serialization format and protocol designed for high performance and compression suitable for
streaming scenarios.

We discuss its usability in scenarios with RDF4J and do a quick demo.

The presentation slides are
