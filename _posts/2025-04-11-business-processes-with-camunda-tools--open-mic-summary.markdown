##### Abstract

Organizations usually operate based on business processes that define how things happen. The definition of these
processes
is often implicit in that it is based on a common understanding of the organization members. This has multiple issues:

- New members may have hard time getting to know the processes
- If the process is understood only by a handful of people, its knowledge may be lost when they leave
- Different people may understand a process differently
- Building an information system based on such a process is challenging

[BPMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation) is a visual business process modeling language
that is understandable by IT professionals as well as domain experts. BPMN models can then serve as a documentation and
communication means for the organization. Moreover, information systems can be built to execute the processes
automatically.

[Camunda](https://camunda.com/) offers an ecosystem of tools that support the development and execution of BPMN models.
In this talk we discuss how these tools can be used to model and execute processes and how they can be integrated into
information systems.
