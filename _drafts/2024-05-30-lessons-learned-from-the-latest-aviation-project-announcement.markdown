Content: The Open mic session starts on Friday, May 31, 2024 at 12:30 at [this link](https://meet.jit.si/open-mic-kbss). The speaker is [Miroslav Blaško](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/team#miroslav-blaško), leader of the KBSS research group. He will discuss the lessons learned from the latest aviation project, which involves developing an information system for AERO Vodochody AEROSPACE a.s (AVA). This system aims to collect and process operational data to enhance the safety and reliability of aircraft. A key objective of the operational data is to provide input for failure analysis using the Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) technique.

##### The abstract

This presentation outlines the development workflow and tools utilized in creating an information system for AERO Vodochody AEROSPACE a.s. It will cover the application of KBSS tools such as SPipes, SForms, and JOPA and address the new challenges encountered during the project. Additionally, the presentation will delve into using GitHub for project management and git workflows, Figma for design, and Docker for orchestration, highlighting associated issues. Challenges related to integrating Keycloak for user management across multiple applications, refactoring RDF data, and shaping RDF data within REST APIs will also be discussed. The session will conclude with insights on using conversational AI in the development process.
